    ----------
    initial_walker :
        Walker that we start the simulation from. Ideally chosen according to
        the trial.
    nup :
        Number of electrons in up-spin space.
    ndown :
        Number of electrons in down-spin space.
    nbasis :
        Number of sites in the 1D Holstein chain.
    nwalkers :
        Number of walkers in the simulation.
    verbose :
        Print level.
